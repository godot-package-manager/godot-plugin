# Godot Package Manager

[![Chat on Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/853476898071117865?label=chat&logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/6mcdWWBkrr)

A package manager for Godot. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) allows for arbitrary
packages to be uploaded, so why not upload Godot addons there to be automatically
managed?

## Using Packages Quickstart

1. Install the gpm

   - clone this repo
   - compile
   - put in path
   <!-- (work in progress steps) -->

2. Find some [Godot packages on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:godot-engine)
3. Add them to the `godot.package` file [(See the `godot.package` section)](#godotpackage)
4. Run the gpm: `./gpm --update`

## Publishing Packages Quickstart

1. Download the [npm cli tool](https://github.com/npm/cli)
2. Copy your `README.md` and `LICENSE` files into the addon folder (if you don't have these, you should create them)
3. In your addon folder, run `npm init` or `npm init --scope=<your scope>` (e.g. given `addons/my_plugin/`, run these commands in the `my_plugin` folder)
4. Answer the prompts given by `npm`
5. Run `npm publish --access public` to publish your package. [See the npm docs for more details](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages)

## CLI

Update

```bash
./gpm --update
```

Purge

```bash
./gpm --purge
```

## `godot.package`

Describes packages to be installed. This _should_ be modified
by the user.

This file can be in different markup languages:

<details open>
<summary>JSON</summary>

```jsonc
{
  // comments are supported
  "packages": {
    "package": "1.0.0", // as are trailing commas
  }
}
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>YAML</summary>

```yaml
packages:
  package: 1.0.0
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>TOML</summary>

```toml
[packages]
package = "1.0.0"
```

</details>

## `godot.lock`

Keeps track of currently installed packages.

This is auto-generated by the addon and should not be modified manually.

```JSON
{
  "package": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "integrity": "3fddc139b1d6ed4cb530967f190bfbbd7f4a7f5c8ed968c57b1c7d2ae24ba14c"
   }
}
```

## To Do

- Automatically add packages listed in `godot.lock` to the user's `.gitignore`
