# Godot Package Manager

[![Chat on Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/853476898071117865?label=chat&logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/6mcdWWBkrr)

A package manager for Godot. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) allows for arbitrary
packages to be uploaded, so why not upload Godot addons there to be automatically
managed?

## Using Packages Quickstart

1. Install the gpm

   - clone this repo
   - compile
   - put in path
   <!-- (work in progress steps) -->

2. Find some [Godot packages on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:godot-engine)
3. Add them to the `godot.package` file [(See the `godot.package` section)](#godotpackage)
4. Run the gpm: `./gpm --update`

## Publishing Packages Quickstart

1. Download the [npm cli tool](https://github.com/npm/cli)
2. Copy your `README.md` and `LICENSE` files into the addon folder (if you don't have these, you should create them)
3. In your addon folder, run `npm init` or `npm init --scope=<your scope>` (e.g. given `addons/my_plugin/`, run these commands in the `my_plugin` folder)
4. Answer the prompts given by `npm`
5. Run `npm publish --access public` to publish your package. [See the npm docs for more details](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages)

## CLI

Update

```bash
./gpm --update
```

Purge

```bash
./gpm --purge
```

## `godot.package`

Describes packages to be installed along with run hooks. This _should_ be modified
by the user.

```JSONC
{
    "packages": { // comments are supported
        "package_name": "version_string", // as are trailing commas
    }
}
```

> **Note**
>
> - Unrecognized fields will be ignored. This can be useful for storing additional data or notes.
> - All scripts and expressions are passed the containing `GodotPackageManager` as `gpm` as a function parameter

## `godot.lock`

Keeps track of currently installed packages.

This is auto-generated by the addon and should not be modified manually.

```JSON
{
    "package_name": {
        "version": "version_string",
        "integrity": "sha_string"
    }
}
```

## To Do

- Automatically add packages listed in `godot.lock` to the user's `.gitignore`
